# Summary (bulleted)

+ Why did we do this?
+ How did we do this?
+ Brief statement of # institutions and # services
+ Brief statement about results (widespread, rare)
+ UAL compared to peers (above regression line)
+ Next steps? Where should we invest?

# Introduction

1 (short) paragraph of high-level introduction, why did we do this?
Data support at libraries growing
Areas that UAL could invest more in?

# Background / Methods
1 paragraph of methods, setting up landscape
Also include salary stuff
Limitations of approach

# Findings

## How many services per library?
## How many libraries for each service?

![**A**. Frequency of services supported across institutions; bars shown in red represent services offered by UAL; grey bars indicate services not supported by UAL. **B**. Number of services across institutions; vertical dotted black line is average number of services offered by libraries (10.7) and red vertical line indicates number of services offered by UAL (13)](output/service-dist-ranks-az.png)

## Services by salary
![Total number of services offered as a function of library's total annual salaries and wages. Dotted line shows regression excluding outlier Washington State University (lower left corner); solid line shows regression excluding Washington State University and Stanford University (upper right corner); red dot (upper left) is UAL.](output/salaries-services-az.png)

# Insights / Conclusions?
Areas where we are like our peers
Are we doing anything special (i.e. the rarities)?
Where could we send more resources?

# Benefits & outcomes
1 paragraph describing benefits to relevant stakeholders
1 paragraph about measurable outcomes; can be integrated with benefits description

# Closing summary
1 paragraph re-iterating problem and solution
