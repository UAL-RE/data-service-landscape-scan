# Data service landscape scan

Code and data for a landscape scan of data services at academic libraries

## Summary

This work generally focuses on four questions:

1. Which research data services does an academic library provide?
2. For a subset of those services, what form does the support come in? i.e.
consulting, instruction, or web resources?
3. Are there differences in support between three categories of services: data 
management, geospatial, and data science?
3. How does library resourcing (i.e. salaries) affect the number of research 
data services?

## Approach

Using direct survey of web resources, we investigated the services offered at 
25 Research 1 universities in the United States of America
